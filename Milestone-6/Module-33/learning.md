It allows one program to request information or services from another without needing to know the details of how that other program works.For example, when you use an app to check the weather, the app asks an API to get the latest weather data. The API fetches the information from a server and sends it back to the app, so you can see the weather on your screen.In short, an API helps apps and websites share data or services easily!```
